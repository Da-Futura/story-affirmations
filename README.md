# Flask + Typescript + React sample app

## Setup
After cloning the repo, run the bootstrap script to install basic python and
js dependencies.
```bash
./bin/bootstrap.sh
```

## Up and running
To run both the API and UI in hot-reload mode:
```bash
# must be run from the project root...
./bin/run_dev.sh
```

This will start parcel in `watch` mode and flask server in `development` mode.
